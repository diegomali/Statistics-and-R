Write a program that takes input of an integer N, followed by N lines of N integers. Each integer is either 1 or zero. The program then outputs an N x N matrix where each block indicates the number of 1's around that block, (excluding the block itself) . For Block 0 on row 0, surrounding blocks are (0,1) (1,0) and (1,1). Similary for block (1,1) all the blocks are to be counted as surrounding blocks.

Your output lines should not have any trailing or leading whitespaces
In case of error your output should be only "0"
